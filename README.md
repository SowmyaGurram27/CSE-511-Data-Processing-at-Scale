# CSE-511-Data-Processing-at-Scale
Database systems are used to provide convenient access to disk-resident data through efficient
query processing, indexing structures, concurrency control, and recovery. This course delves into
new frameworks for processing and generating large-scale datasets with parallel and distributed
algorithms, covering the design, deployment, and use of state-of-the-art data processing systems,
which provide scalable access to data.
